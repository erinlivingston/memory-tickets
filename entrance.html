      <p>Tickets are scraps of our movement & time, and our transactions & consumption. 
        <br> </br>
        Once a material piece
        of travel memory,
        now, part of digital fabrics that form global infrastructures & interfaces. 
        <br> </br>
        This project plays with digital ticketing from commuter rail and explores a collection of 
        ticket screenshots as mnemonic objects. Enter the train to subvert color and time, and to consider an embodied digital travel memory.

      <p>Trains have a form of time all their own. 
        <br></br> In physics, trains are a crucial example of Relative 
        Time, a part of Einstein's theory of relativity. It means, simply put, that time depends on our movement in & through space.
        <br></br> 
        On the contemporary train, this relative time becomes a digital interface, used to transact, surveille, and erase 
        riders to the rail's benefit. 
        It extracts departure and destination, and categorizes our space 
        and movement into tiers of profit.
        <br></br>
        During these slots, our to and from home, time in the middle is forgotten. Where do we go in our minds to escape these in-between moments? Why do we leave them behind?
