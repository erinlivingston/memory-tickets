        <p> This piece used twenty digital ticket screenshots transformed to hand-crafted paper tickets with color bar timestamps made from Perler beads. These colored bars on digital transit tickets - flashing, shifting, and synchronized across all riders - are the most visually dominant feature of the interface. Colors become a trace more memorable than the destinations, rides, or dates themselves.

        <h2> Activate Ticket</h2>
        <p> This is a placeholder section of text to explain how the contemporary half-digital, half-not project 
            was born out of the 2019 piece, digital memory theory, and data x artwork & design interest. A sort of brief artist statement, 
            I think I could rename this page as the index, or breakdown - the components of the project, and context or why (README,
            link to Github and/or the Memory Studies Volume 5)

    <section id = "essay">
        <h2> Digital Memory</h2>
        <h2> <i>mnemonic object in transit infrastructure</i> </h2>
         <p> My project is grounded in several theoretical frameworks from memory studies to creatively explore tensions between personal memory, transit media infrastructure, and digital ephemerality. Using Jan Assman’s distinction between functional and stored memory, the digital ticket can be seen as a unit of stored memory. 
            It’s a record stripped of affect and wielded by the transit system to temporarily track and log riders’ movements.

            These tickets resist permanence, they disappear after use and exist only briefly on screens. This temporary nature resists admittance or analysis in formal archives. In this way, they reflect what Amanda Mandolessi describes as “mnemonic assemblages” of digital memory, an ecosystem of traces with enduring ephemerality. Jess Baines’ observation of digital memory’s tendency toward loss and disappearance frames this project’s recordkeeping as a response, a micro-archive created from the fleeting. Michelle Caswell’s notion of “chrono autonomy,” the power to shape one’s relationship to time, aligns with the pairing of color and time as an aesthetic mnemonic strategy. Tickets in my original 2019 project were chosen based on my favorite, and also the most striking, color combinations. Color becomes a tool for reclaiming the otherwise automated time stamp. 
            
            Finally, this project and its material approach takes inspiration from Alison Chidgey’s work on DIY media which celebrates the political and affective potential of documenting singular experience within the collective. Within transit systems built for efficiency, not remembrance, individuality is lost to repetition and scale. Reconstructing and exploring these tickets as artifacts of memory challenges the neutrality of infrastructure and reclaims a personal narrative from within the identity-flattening and coagulated flows of mass transit.
