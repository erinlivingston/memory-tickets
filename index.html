        <h1>Digital Transit Ticket Microarchive</h1>
        <p> A mixed media journey about digital transit memory.
            Ticket screenshots within this microarchive are colorful mnemonic objects that form a mini database of color. This 
            project was created while reading and discussing in the 2025 spring section of Digital Memory at CUNY Graduate Center. </p>  
        <h2>Commuting Sludge</h2>
        <p> 
            Traveling two hours, twice a day, in mass-migration was my identity-flattening right of passage into an annual salary.
            <br></br> 
            And as the White Western World dictates, a passage of moving out of my parents’ house and holding myself up.
            <br></br>
            I was exhausted entering the rush hour ‘sludge,’ as I called it. Though it also became a time of refuge to journal, plan, meditate, complain, to rest or forget.

                    "Four Weeks at Work" is a mixed-media piece I made in 2019. It’s a for-fun journal response to the ‘sludge,’ and reflects my curiosity toward color-based time and transit systems. 
                    <br></br>
                    Being in the dreary fabric of commuter rail, I was delighted with the color feature uniting riders, and appreciated randomness in an otherwise scheduled train world. 
                    <br></br>
                    I started screen-shotting my daily digital tickets when I entered the train, activated, and immediately liked their color. After several months of taking them, 
                    I wanted to create something with the palette to materialize the digital exercise. 
                    I selected images with my favorite color combinations, and created the tickets as material so I could appreciate and remember the 
                    color triplets off the train. 
                    <br></br> 
                    An entry from my journal, written on the train, while working on the original piece:
                </p>

                <div id= "erinjournalquote">
                    <p> “I see a tugboat pushing a bardge that says "HELP" or maybe it's "KELP." <br></br>
                        I'ts punch day, people with physical monthlies are getting them punched. <br></br>
                        Good morning colors on the train ticket. <br></br>
                        Perler bead arrival last night, plastic smell is strong.”
                        <br></br>
                        - Erin 3.4.2020
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class = "art-preview">
                <img src="assets/art/process.jpg"  alt="Process of making the tickets"> </img>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The color bar field of the tickets are best-matched to Perler Beads, and the ticket tile layers are made with cardstock. Identifying information is stripped away. Each ticket is anonymous except for its color. I picked 20 total for the group, and placed them in a grid of 5 tickets by 4 rows. This is meant to represent a 5 day work week in 1 calendar month. 
                    <br></br>
                    This piece borrows a calendar as a mnemonic device. Tickets are in time order, but the distances between each vary. In some cases, there are two-tickets selected from one day, though they appear side-by-side. 
                    <br></br>
                    This grid hides its details, and conceals the nature of self-erasing time. It feels full but represents short pieces of ride time, and has many missing tickets between ‘days.’ Mounted on clear acrylic, you can confirm ticket details on the back, but the rest of the time it’s a nondescript rainbow calendar.

                <p> Abbreviated Description :)
                    <br> </br>
                    This piece used twenty digital ticket screenshots transformed to hand-crafted paper tickets. The color bar timestamps are made from Perler beads. These colored bars on digital transit tickets - flashing, shifting, and synchronized across all riders - are the most visually dominant feature of the interface. Colors become a trace more memorable than the destinations, rides, or dates themselves. 
                    These tickets anonymize time and the memories within commuting and replace them in new, colorful, form. </p>

        <h2> Digital Memory</h2>
        <h2> <i>colors as mnemonic object in transit infrastructure</i> </h2>
         <p> My project is grounded in several theoretical frameworks from memory studies to creatively explore tensions between personal memory, transit media infrastructure, and digital ephemerality. 
            <br></br>
            Using Jan Assman’s distinction between functional and stored memory, the digital ticket can be seen as a unit of stored memory. 
            It’s a record stripped of affect and wielded by the transit system to temporarily track and log riders’ movements.

            These tickets resist permanence, they disappear after use and exist only briefly on screens. 
            This temporary nature resists admittance or analysis in formal archives. In this way, they reflect what Amanda Mandolessi describes as “mnemonic assemblages” of digital memory, 
            an ecosystem of traces with enduring ephemerality. 
            <br></br>
            Jess Baines’ observation of digital memory’s tendency toward loss and disappearance frames this project’s recordkeeping as a response, a micro-archive created from the fleeting. 
            Michelle Caswell’s notion of “chrono autonomy,” the power to shape one’s relationship to time, aligns with the pairing of color and time as an aesthetic mnemonic strategy. 
            Tickets in my original 2019 project were chosen based on my favorite, and also the most striking, color combinations. 
            Color becomes a tool for reclaiming the otherwise automated time stamp. Finally, this project and its material approach takes inspiration from Alison Chidgey’s work on DIY media 
            which celebrates the political and affective potential of documenting singular experience within the collective. 
            <br></br>
            Within transit systems built for efficiency, not remembrance, individuality is lost to repetition and scale. 
            Reconstructing and exploring these tickets as artifacts of memory challenges the neutrality of infrastructure and reclaims a personal narrative from within the identity-flattening 
            and coagulated flows of mass transit.
