            <p> In development of this project during Digital Memory, I gathered my complete collection of screenshot tickets from 2019 - 2024. After creating "Four Weeks at Work" in 2019, I continued my screenshot 
                habit, usually when I activated my tickets and found color combinations interesting 
                (or remembered the project). 
                <br></br>
                This micro archive of consists of 168 image files each signifying a literal split second in my cummulative train ridership. 
                The tickets are a mere fraction of all those I've ever had, but still represent over $5,000 in travel costs. 
            
                There would be no way to access these unique interfaces without my screenshots, as there's no way to review, save, or interact
                with our ridership data in mass-transit systems. <br></br> In my 2025 evolution of this project I consider these tickets as saved moments 
                of my life in the moments of in-between. I use code to extract their colors, and material forms to investigate their features.
                I toggle between material and digital to let insights of the infrastructure emerge for the user. </p>
